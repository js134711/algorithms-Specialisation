This repository contains code adapted from the book 'Genome Scale Algorithm Design'. None of the code is taken from any AI. Though it may contain some ideas from AI but not vibe coded. rankOperations.ipynb contains code 
for calculation of GC content with sliding window of 10KB. Its a introductory and amateurish repository any developments are welcome from anyone who landed in this for some reason. Code may look cluttered and you may not 
get anything but it works everything I put in this repository are tested using naive algorithms.
